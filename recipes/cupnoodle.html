    <h3 id="head">Description</h3>

    <p class="paracenter">Cup Noodle, the instant noodle in a cup, is a beloved snack around the world. Created by Momofuku
        Ando in 1971, it revolutionized the instant noodle game by allowing people to enjoy hot, delicious noodles on
        the go. Ando was inspired to create Cup Noodle after seeing Americans enjoying their soup out of cups. He
        thought, "Why not put noodles in a cup, too?" The rest is history.</p>
    <p class="paracenter">
        Over the years, Cup Noodle has become an iconic snack, loved by everyone from college students to busy
        professionals. It's the perfect solution for those times when you're too lazy to cook or when you're just
        craving something salty and delicious. Plus, who can resist peeling back the lid and revealing those steamy
        noodles? It's like a mini adventure in every cup.
