    <h3>Recipe</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice according to the package instructions and set it aside to cool. It's best to use day-old rice
            for this recipe as it will have a better texture.
        </li>

        <li>In a wok or a large skillet, heat some vegetable oil over high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the diced
            chicken and cook until it's no longer pink.
        </li>

        <li>Push the chicken to the sides of the wok and add some minced garlic to the center. Stir the garlic until
            fragrant, then add the beaten eggs and scramble them until they are fully cooked.
        </li>

        <li>Mix the cooked chicken, garlic, and eggs together in the wok.
        </li>

        <li>Add your choice of vegetables, such as peas, carrots, onions, or green onions. Stir-fry the vegetables for a
            few minutes until they are tender.
        </li>

        <li>Add the cooled rice to the wok and stir everything together until the rice is well combined with the other
            ingredients.
        </li>

        <li>Add soy sauce and sesame oil to the wok, and continue to stir everything together.
        </li>
        
        <li>Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
        </li>
        
        <li>Once everything is heated through and well combined, turn off the heat and serve your homemade fried rice
            hot with your favorite protein or enjoy it on its own as a vegetarian dish.
        </li>
